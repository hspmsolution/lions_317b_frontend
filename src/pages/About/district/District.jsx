              Dear Members and Sevayatris, Greetings from District 317-B!
              <br />
              <br />
              Most Lions Districts in India tend to be within the confines of a
              single state which are traditionally dictated b linguistic lines.
              Hence the state language is utilized in all Lions meetings and
              proceedings, just as it happens internationally In our District a
              plethora of languages and dialects are spoken, ranging from
              English, Konkani, Kannada, Marathi and Telugu, due to its
              geographical heterogeneity Just like varied languages, the
              cuisine, costume and culture also varies across its geographical
              entirety, we may say, it differs almost every 50 kilometers. Yet,
              inspite of these differences, in spirit of Lionism, we emerge as
              one family. This spirit binds almost 3500 fellow Lions in an area
              of around 80,000 square kilometers and a population of over 2
              crores, into one of the most versatile UNIQUE DISTRICTS of the
              world.
